<strong>Variant calling using deep convolutional neural networks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aims</strong> In this project, we are exploring a deep convolutional neural network for variant calling. The model is trained on high-quality variant calls of NA12877 and NA12878​ ​provided by the Illumina Platinum Genomes project. The project aims is to compare the performance of CNN-based variant classifier with GATK Haplotype Caller, VarScan, and Freebayes.</p>

<strong>Master’s Internship | Development of Real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) Pipeline at Donders Institute</strong><span id="my-inline-urls"><a href="http://analyze4d.com/misc_adnan/Development-of-real-time-fMRI-pipeline_at_Donders_institute_Internship-report-Adnan-Niazi.pdf">[pdf]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Aims and Significance:</strong> Functional MRI scanners are designed to output their acquired images only when a scanning session has completed. This is fine for most neuroscience studies that involve post-hoc data analysis,
but for neurofeedback experiments — studies in which a subject’s current brain activity is used to present a feedback so that the subject may consciously modulate his subsequent brain activity — scans are needed while they are being acquired by the scanner. To address this need, an rtfMRI pipeline was designed that extracted these scans from the MRI scanner on-the-fly during a scanning session. The rtfMRI pipeline I developed now forms an integral component of fMRI-based neurofeedback studies conducted at the Donders Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions:</strong> I co-developed the rtfMRI pipeline, and designed and conducted experiments on it to validate and test its performance.</p>

<p><strong>Aim:</strong> Can machine learning be applied on functional MRI scans of the visual cortex to decode in real time what a human subject is currently seeing or imagining.</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Brain reading — as it is commonly called — was previously shown to work in an offline line setting, but we demonstrated a computationally efficient real-time neurofeedback system for decoding human
perception on a moment-to-moment basis.</p>
<p><strong>Contributions:</strong> I designed experiments, collected data, analyzed it, and wrote a peer-reviewed journal article.</p>

<strong>Research Assistantship | Investigating Neurofeedback Strategies for Conscious Modulation of Brain Activity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aims and Significance:</strong> I designed real-time fMRI neurofeedback experiments to understand how subjects can consciously modulate their brain activity. Because fMRI scanners are costly to operate, I was also responsible for optimizing the real-time fMRI experiments and then presenting them to the institutional review committee for approval of the scanner time.</p>
